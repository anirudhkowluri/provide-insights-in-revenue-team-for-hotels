Hospitality Revenue Insights – Power BI Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on providing data-driven revenue insights for AtliQ Grands, a luxury and business hotel chain operating across multiple cities in India.
Due to increasing competition and declining market share, the management aimed to leverage Business & Data Intelligence to improve decision-making.

As a Data Analyst, I analyzed historical hotel performance data and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to support the Revenue Management Team with actionable insights.

Track key hospitality KPIs such as Revenue, RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %, and Realisation %
